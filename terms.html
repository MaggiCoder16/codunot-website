    <section class="card section">
      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By adding Codunot to a Discord server, authorizing the Codunot app, or using Codunot features,
        you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms").
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not agree with these Terms, you must not use Codunot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Codunot provides AI chat, generation features, utility commands, and server configuration tools intended
        to help communities run smoother interactions.
      </p>

    <section class="card section">
      <h2>2. Use of the Bot and App</h2>

      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card section">
      <h2>3. Server Owner and Admin Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>
        If you add Codunot to a server, you are responsible for configuring permissions and usage policies
        appropriately for your community.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure only trusted roles can access sensitive bot commands.</li>
        <li>Review moderation and command behavior before production use.</li>
        <li>Use channel/server configuration features to limit bot scope where needed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Codunot does not replace moderator judgment. Final enforcement decisions remain with server staff.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card section">
      <h2>4. Feature Availability and Changes</h2>
      <p>
        Codunot features may be added, modified, rate-limited, deprecated, or removed at any time for reliability,
        safety, legal compliance, or product improvement reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not guarantee permanent availability of any specific feature, command, model, integration, or output format.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card section">
      <h2>5. Vote-Gated Access and Usage Limits</h2>
      <p>
        Certain capabilities may require vote unlocks and/or usage limits. Unlock duration, gating conditions,
        and limit policies may be updated as needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Attempting to bypass vote checks, abuse unlock mechanisms, or evade usage limits is prohibited
        and may lead to access termination.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card section">
      <h2>6. Premium Services and Billing Terms</h2>

        We are not liable for disruptions caused by third-party dependency failures outside our direct control.

      <h2>10. Enforcement and Termination</h2>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to suspend, restrict, or terminate access to Codunot for any user or server

      <ul>
